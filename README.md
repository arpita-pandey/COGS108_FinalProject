Impact of Generative AI on U.S. Industry Employment
(January 2025 - March 2025)

Introduction

The advancement of technology, specifically the usage of artificial intelligence (AI), has sparked difficult conversations as well as fear among individuals about job security. Although the incorporation of artificial intelligence has benefitted many sectors in improving efficiency in pre-existing processes, it has also raised concerns when it comes to job displacement. This project aims to examine the relationship between unemployment rates and the increase of AI model usage within the United States from 2010 to 2023 across various industries. Our initial prediction was that higher rates of AI adoption would be associated with variations in employment patterns, as higher use of AI models in the workplace will also lead to shifts in workforce demands while some traditional roles will decline. However, a closer look at the data from the past decade suggests a different conclusion that, perhaps rather than displacement, something greater like the incorporation of AI models in the workplace might be taking place instead. By cleaning and processing the data across multiple industries, not only those industries that are the most feared of being displaced, we examined the relationship between AI usage and unemployment rates.



Tools Used

Leveraged Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) to explore and analyze AI adoption and unemployment trends across industries. Cleaned and preprocessed datasets by standardizing labels, removing outliers, and engineering features (e.g., AI workload ratio). Identified an inverse correlation between AI impact and unemployment, with direct correlation between AI workload and unemployment in high-revenue sectors.
