Impact of Generative AI on U.S. Industry Employment
(January 2025 - March 2025)

Leveraged Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) to explore and analyze AI adoption and unemployment trends across industries. Cleaned and preprocessed datasets by standardizing labels, removing outliers, and engineering features (e.g., AI workload ratio). Identified an inverse correlation between AI impact and unemployment, with direct correlation between AI workload and unemployment in high-revenue sectors.
