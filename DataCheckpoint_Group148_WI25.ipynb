    "We predict that higher rates of AI adoption—defined as the integration of AI-driven automation, decision-making, and augmentation tools within industry sectors—will be associated with variations in employment patterns. Specifically, industries with higher AI adoption may experience shifts in workforce demand, where some traditional roles decline while new AI-related opportunities emerge. The extent to which AI adoption impacts employment will likely depend on industry investment in retraining and upskilling programs, with sectors that prioritize workforce adaptation experiencing more stable employment outcomes over time."

    "Within our two datasets, our first dataset \"From Data Entry to CEO: The AI Job Threat Index\" has no personal data included, so there is no concern for privacy regarding this dataset. Within our second dataset, \"US Monthly Unemployment Rate 1948 - Present\", there is also no personal data included, as this is just a survey of unemployment rates per month, so there is no privacy concerns as well. However, bias concerns exist within the first dataset. We discovered that the owner of the dataset scrapped the data from multiple \"reputable\" sources, however, these sources utilized to scrape the data were not mentioned. As such, it is difficult to pinpoint where exactly the data came from for all of the data, and this is something we will have to closely monitor and address if we find the original source. Moreover, our second dataset has data until 2019, so we would need to find another source that gives us the unemployment rate per month from 2020 to present. Since the data we deal with is mostly regarding the efficiency of AI in jobs and how well it has done a certain job, numeric data will be the primary focus of this project, and as such, forging of numeric data is very common in order to make sure that a certain bias exists within job displacement due to artificial intelligence. To handle these issues, we will cross-reference the data in the dataset with information online (ideally, we would try to find the original data, but we will gather information from multiple sources to verify this information). Other than this, there are no other issues related to topic area, data, and analyses regarding data privacy and equitable impact, as the data merely shows how impacted certain roles were in correspondance to unemployment rates."
